A doctor who was reprimanded by local police for trying to warn doctors about the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan has died after being infected by the virus, Chinese media has reported.
Li Wenliang was one of eight whistleblowers who tried to send a message to other medics about a Sars-like illness at the end of December.

In December, Dr Li was accused of spreading rumours by Chinese police and summoned to a government Public Security Bureau, where he was warned that he should not continue to make comments that “disturb the social order”.

“We solemnly warn you: If you keep being stubborn, with such impertinence, and continue this illegal activity, **you will be brought to justice** – is that understood?” an official letter given to the doctor said.

China’s Supreme Court later criticised police in Wuhan for the crackdown and admitted that the information about the virus was not completely inaccurate.

Dr Li was diagnosed with coronavirus on 30 January after treating patients in the outbreak, which has killed more than 550 people and infected more than 28,000.

## Public Outcry
In death, Dr. Li Wenliang became the face of simmering anger at the ruling Communist Party’s controls over information and complaints that officials lie about or hide disease outbreaks, chemical spills, dangerous consumer products or financial frauds.

The 34-year-old ophthalmologist died overnight at Wuhan Central Hospital, where he worked and likely contracted the virus while treating patients in the early days of the outbreak. 

“A hero who released information about Wuhan’s epidemic in the early stage, Dr. Li Wenliang is immortal,” the China Center for Disease Control’s chief scientist, Zeng Guang, wrote on the Sina Weibo microblog service.
